 (17.2 cm - 17.8cm).","creation_tsz":1520539283,"ending_tsz":1531076483,"original_creation_tsz":1344550380,"last_modified_tsz":1520539284,"price":"67.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["Beaded bracelet","mint green","sterling silver","bali silver","mint julep","925 silver","handcrafted","heavy silver","tiger eye","silver bracelet","oblong focal","lampwork bracelet","whiskey brown"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Bracelet"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,68888548],"materials":["Glass","Silver"],"shop_section_id":12056061,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1517664614,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/106475600\/bali-sterling-silver-bracelet-lampwork?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":92,"num_favorers":7,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2018","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":null,"style":["Southwestern","Derby"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":false,"language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1193,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Bracelets"],"used_manufacturer":false,"sku":[],"Images":[{"listing_image_id":364185456,"hex_code":"C8C8C4","red":200,"green":200,"blue":196,"hue":60,"saturation":2,"brightness":78,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1344550380,"listing_id":106475600,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_75x75.364185456_ih4j.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_170x135.364185456_ih4j.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_570xN.364185456_ih4j.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_fullxfull.364185456_ih4j.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":364193579,"hex_code":"7F8585","red":127,"green":133,"blue":133,"hue":180,"saturation":4,"brightness":52,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1344550380,"listing_id":106475600,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_75x75.364193579_a9ep.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_170x135.364193579_a9ep.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_570xN.364193579_a9ep.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_fullxfull.364193579_a9ep.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":364185370,"hex_code":"CCD0D1","red":204,"green":208,"blue":209,"hue":192,"saturation":2,"brightness":81,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1344550380,"listing_id":106475600,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_75x75.364185370_954v.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_170x135.364185370_954v.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_570xN.364185370_954v.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_fullxfull.364185370_954v.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":364193515,"hex_code":"B5B4AB","red":181,"green":180,"blue":171,"hue":54,"saturation":5,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1344550380,"listing_id":106475600,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_75x75.364193515_s1oh.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_170x135.364193515_s1oh.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_570xN.364193515_s1oh.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/5208093\/il_fullxfull.364193515_s1oh.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":364193409,"hex_code":"C2C3BC","red":194,"green":195,"blue":188,"hue":68,"saturation":3,"brightness":76,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1344550380,"listing_id":106475600,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_75x75.364193409_cblb.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_170x135.364193409_cblb.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_570xN.364193409_cblb.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/001\/0\/5208093\/il_fullxfull.364193409_cblb.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5208093,"shop_name":"upzndowns","user_id":5328553,"creation_tsz":1193321929,"title":"French beaded flowers & unique beaded accessories","announcement":"I commit botanical anarchy using tiny beads & wire, dabble in artisan jewelry & have been known to decorate anything that doesn&#39;t move.

Also, once you&#39;ve discussed a custom band with us and you order, please remember to put any special requests and changes in the notes to seller section of checkout- it helps us tremendously to have all of the information we need in one place.

You can clean your ring with a soft cloth and any furniture polish, or even olive oil on a soft cloth. We&#39;d suggest keeping your ring away from anything caustic that could damage the finish. If your finish is ever damaged or needs reapplying, we can do that for just $10 for the life of your ring. We also can replace a damaged inlay at any time for the same cost.\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\nAll of our rings come in a small, handcrafted wooden ring box that is perfect for gift giving. If you&#39;re sending a gift, let us know- we can include a note and ensure that there&#39;s no receipt included.\n\nRESIZING\nOur rings are not resizable. We can sometimes make an existing ring larger by about half a size, but never more than that, and we can never make them smaller. We recommend using our ring sizer for a good fit, to avoid any issues with sizing. There&#39;s no charge for our sizer. If we need to make a ring larger by more than half a size, or make a ring smaller, that means beginning again with a new ring. For this we ask for return of the original ring and half its cost. A remake will take the same time to make as a regular order; three to four weeks. Please let us know about any sizing issues within 30 days of receipt of your ring.\n\nWe cannot accept cancellation requests once a sizer has been mailed.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH YOUR ORDER\/RETURNS\nIf there is a problem with your order, just let us know. We are committed to ensuring that our customers love their rings, and are glad to work out any issues with orders. \n\nWe accept returns for rings that are not engraved, or customized in any way from the listing images. Engraved rings or rings that have been customized with different materials, or otherwise altered (for example, by changing the finish, band profile, etc.) are not eligible for return. There are no exceptions to this policy. \n\nWe can be reached via Etsy convos, via email at robandlean@yahoo.com, and by phone at our retail location at 417 962 0357 (our hours are 8am to 4:30pm central, Monday through Friday.)\n\nGUARANTEE\nWe guarantee all of our rings to be free of defects in manufacture for 90 days after receipt. (This does not include resizing rings.)\n\nENGRAVING\nWe can engrave up to 20 characters in our rings; just let us know what you&#39;d like engraved in the notes box at checkout. Limit your engraving to letters and numbers and simple punctuation. Engraved rings can not be returned.\n\nVARIATIONS IN WOOD AND STONE\nWe use real hardwoods and stone in our inlays; for this reason, you should expect variations in your ring verses the image in the listing you order. The color and grain pattern can vary  from inlay to inlay just as color and grain varies in different pieces of wood. We will not guarantee that a ring will look exactly like the image in our listing, although we do promise to use the variety shown and to use the best quality wood and stone that we can obtain. Your ring by Rob and Lean is a unique custom piece :). If you have questions about this, just contact us!\n\nPRODUCTION TIME\nWe need 2-3 weeks to complete an order. Often rings ship earlier than this production time. Our rings are handmade, one at a time. If you are in a rush to receive your ring, you can purchase a rush order listing and expedited shipping listing in our shop. Finally, if we need to order in materials for a custom ring, your production time may be affected.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\nWe use standard US ring sizing, including half and quarter sizes. If you don&#39;t know what size ring you need, we will be glad to mail you a ring sizer free of charge, after you place an order. Just let us know that you need a sizer when you check out. If you get sized at a department store jewelry counter or another jeweler, we will not be responsible for mis sized rings. Unfortunately not all sizing tools are created equally. The best way to figure size if you really don&#39;t know is to get our free ring sizer mailed.\n\nWider rings fit more snugly than narrower rings of the same size, so if you&#39;re ordering a wider band, it&#39;s a good idea to order up a bit for comfort.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458239200,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"Rings by Rob and Lean is on vacation!

Produce the Finest Ferments. \n\nKombucha Tea, Ginger Beer, Japanese Water Crystals, California Bees, Tibicos, Water Kefir,  Vinegar, Cider, Wine, Beer, or Whiskey or your own special brew.  Everything is simply better brewed or aged in wood barrels. \n\nComes with wood or cork cover, all wood spigot, sterilizing and conditioning tablets,  our HappyHerbalist&#39;s Continuous Brewing  Guide. \n\nGuaranteed Satisfaction. 30 day guaranteed not to leak. \n\nAll natural all wood. We do not varnish or coat the outside of our barrels, A outside coating will prevent the barrel (and the ferment) from receiving oxygen. This albeit minute exchange is necessary for the proper fermentation of both aerobic and anaerobic ferments and proper aging of the ferment. essential to properly release oaky flavor and color to the contents. Varnish only serves to keep the outside of the barrel looking good. Nor do we wax line our barrels. Wax lining is used in some French Vinegar production. Wax prevents alcohol from being absorbed by the barrel, and thus less conversion of alcohol to acetic acid and weaker the vinegar. Not a problem for our family folk ferments where less alcohol is preferred. \n\n \nSizes of our Barrels and Brewing Capacity.\n \n5 liter (1 1\/3 Gallon)  measures 8 x 8 x 11 High\n\nBrewing Capacity (leaving 2 inches from the top) 150 ounces (~ 1 1\/5 Gal) \n\n produces 16 - 31 ounces daily \n\n \n10 liter (2 1\/2 Gallon)  measures  10 x 10 x 12 High\n\nBrewing Capacity ((leaving 2 inches from the top) 288 ounces (~ 2 1\/4 Gal)\n\nproduces 30- 60  ounces daily \n\n \n20 liter (5 Gallon)  measures  12 x 12 x 14 High (open top*) \n\nBrewing Capacity ((leaving 2 inches from the top) 448 ounces (~ 3 1\/2 Gal)\n\nproduces 45-90 ounces daily\n\n* NOTE:  Wood Tops are no longer available for the 20 liter \nthese units will come with a cloth cover and extra large rubber band\n\n \n50 liter (13.2 gallons)  produces 128 - 200 fluid ounces daily. Produce a Gallon or more a Day !\n\n  \nMade from American White Oak.  Why OAK?\n\nOak Barrels adds a nutty, buttery flavor and additional tannins to the ferment. Tannins are necessary to a ferment. In kombucha tannins are obtained from the tea. Tannins also produce the astringent quality that some find appealing.  Though the tannins will be exhausted over the years, they may be replenished with oak chips. \n\nOak Casks also breathes. This allows oxygen into the ferment below the SCOBY, where the bacteria are attempting to suffocate the yeasts into fermentation. This reduces the potential alcohol levels, adds greater yeast contribution to the flavor profile  while allowing greater oxygen to acid ratios producing a crisper fresher brew. \n\n\nWild Lambric Beers. The sour and unique character of these beers originates from the metabolic activities of various yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB). which are fermented and matured  in the same wood casks for up to three years at up to 25C (77F). Does that sound familiar! With Kombucha you don&#39;t have to wait that long ! That&#39;s wild.\n\n Why is the barrel burnt on the inside?\n\nWe give our barrels a medium toast. Toast, or charring is burning the wood to a certain degree. This charcoal serves many purposes. Primary for our ferments, the charcoal filters out undesirable elements like methanol (toxic alcohol). It reduces the ethanol (alcohol) and acetic acid levels slightly which allows a more complete ferment of the sugar. A more mellow brew. \n\nEach year the beneficial probiotic bacteria and yeasts impregnate the wood, over time each cask develops a unique character of health and flavor. One special kombucha yeasts, Brettanomyces, favors wood and may survive alone and abandoned for years. Used properly a cask will last more than a life time. \n\nI have speculated that kombucha may have made its way to America by the Chinese railroad workers, and those panning for gold in the Sierra\u2019s.  They may have found a better use for those discarded beer barrels than just for storing their Chinese tea in. \n\n Why do we place the spigot so high ?\n\nWe intended our barrels for fermenting and not simply to store or age a ferment. Which it does a fine job at. But with an active ferment, the yeast will continue to pile up sediment on the bottom. Many folks find this  sediment (called lee\u2019s) desirable. Finding sediment in your beer bottle is where a brewery deliberately does not filter their beer and its called bottle conditioned, i.e. naturally carbonated and unfiltered beer. \n\nYes, you can eat (or drink) the sediment. It\u2019s just yeasts. High in nutrition, protein and vitamin B\u2019s.  Some folks say it gives them gas, some say it shows their bravery. \n\nSome brews develop fuller more complex profiles when aged on the lees.  None-the-less Sediment will continue to clog the spigot so we moved the spigot up. Besides its easier to fit a glass under.  \n\n \nIndependent testing Kombucha brewed in our Oak Barrels. \n\nWe selected Silver Needle White Tea, as this tea is lightest in flavor and would allow a greater perception of what the Oak had to offer. The results were fantastic. it produced a smoother deeper flavor yet very fine. The White Tea flavor in our opinion was richer but still delicate..  Also as expected from the Oak, there was the mellowness and very slight buttery character. Well brewed. \n\nHowever it  did slightly reduce the gluconic acid levels (when compared to our glass brew). However it should be noted that overall Silver Needle White Tea fermented in a Oak Cask still produced far greater gluconic acid levels than kombucha tea made with a black, green or combination of black and green tea fermented in glass. With our American White Oaks casks you can produce a fine fermented beverage rich in taste and benefits.\n\nOur Oak Casks, with the spigot higher is great for Continuous Brewing Method This is simply the easiest method to ferment kombucha. Once under way just add fresh pure water, sugar and tea.\n\nOf course you may use this art piece as the more common single stage  method but do consider the advantage of the Continuous Brewing method. \n\nWith Continuous Brewing the  \u201coptimum\u201d health benefit of the nutrients are more readily available. Another advantage is that there is no need to do weekly cleaning, no need to worry about the kombucha mushroom, mold is less likely to form , Great Kombucha Tea is readily available, and there is less need to do bottling or extra storage. Simply pour off a cup of perfect Kombucha. \n\nOnly continuous brewing of the kombucha allows the formation of different acids that are constantly being produced and broken down through out the active ferment.  Kombucha Researcher Mike Roussin indicated that at 80F and 7 days the ferment has the greatest variety of health benefits (vitamins, oxalic acid, etc). However, he also noted that the longer fermentation proceeds the more beneficial acids have a chance to form. Some of these acids don&#39;t even appear until 14-21 days in the process.  These acids are largely responsible for the detoxifying nature of Kombucha Tea and are the catalysts we seek in brewing Kombucha Tea. Glucose content maximizes around the 8th or 9th day. This implies that gluconic acid production could not peak until after that point. Gluconic acid is the biggest single contributor to the detox effect.A longer brewing cycle, say 20-30 days, may deplete the total sugar or reduce the caffeine content, but the taste is pretty much undrinkable.  With Continuous Brewing the complete range of nutritional benefits is always present and can be maintained by bottling.\n\n \n\nSetting up your new American Oak Cask\n\nPlace in an area that will allow for some leakage (like in the tub)\n\nPush in the wooden spigot. Add a few light taps with a hammer.\n\nor if using the plastic spigot the washer may go on the inside or outside. Hand tighten only be careful not to overturn and strip the plastic not.\n\nFill 75% with warm water. Avoid getting the outside of the barrel wet. Black spots may appear. Rinse off with vinegar and dry.\n\nLeave until any leaks stop and the wood has properly swollen.\n\nNext, drain the barrel and flush it with clean water until water runs clear from the barrel.\n\nThen add the camden tablets. One tablet per gallon. Dissolve in a glass of warm water, then add to barrel. \n\nSwish and around so it comes in contact with all the interior of the barrel.\n\nDrain the solution,\n\nrinse the barrel well,\n\nYou are now ready to fill with kombucha, Ginger Beer, Japanese Water Crystals, Water Kefir, California Bees, Tibicos or your favorite ferment.\n\nThe barrel should be filled and maintained at 75-80% level.\n\nNOTE: We guarantee our barrels against initial leakage and damage. The barrel is expected to swell and not to leak upon following the directions above. Damage after is not warranted. The TOP, has been cut open. This does not affect the integrity of the barrel, but may cause wrapping and create an uneven surface. We do not guarantee against this type of wrapping. The pieces themselves may be removed. Such removal will not violate the integrity of the barrel. The barrels may discolor, become black on the outside. This is normal. Thee is a food-grade varnish that may be used to prevent this. However we have found the majority of our clients prefer all natural and do not want any ingredients leaking into their brew. All our barrels are all natural, all wood. \n\nNote 2: the interior of the barrel should ALWAYS be moist and should not be allowed to dry out. A dried out barrel will leak. If you decide not to use the barrel for awhile, fill with water, cover and set in a clean cool area. Add campden tablet (one per gallon) for storage, or add a few cups of vinegar. If possible maintain the water below a pH of 4.0.","creation_tsz":1520538737,"ending_tsz":1531075937,"original_creation_tsz":1491083704,"last_modified_tsz":1520538737,"price":"125.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":18,"tags":["oak barrels","oak cask","oak keg","wine barrel","vinegar barrel","kombucha brewer","kombucha fermenter","kombucha brewing","beer barrel","kombucha keg","whiskey barrel","new barrels","kombucha container"],"category_path":["Supplies"],"category_path_ids":[69150433],"materials":["American Oak","Lightly Toasted","Oak Cover","All wood Spigot","Camden sterilization tablets"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1517066641,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/522290371\/american-oak-barrels-for-wine-vinegar?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1979,"num_favorers":38,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"80","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"14","item_width":"12","item_height":"12","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":6526,"taxonomy_path":["Craft Supplies & Tools","Kitchen Supplies","Fermentation & Brewing Supplies","Fermenters"],"used_manufacturer":false,"sku":[],"Images":[{"listing_image_id":1220083705,"hex_code":"AF9E91","red":175,"green":158,"blue":145,"hue":26,"saturation":17,"brightness":68,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1491083704,"listing_id":522290371,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/153\/0\/13584126\/il_75x75.1220083705_ch6h.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/153\/0\/13584126\/il_170x135.1220083705_ch6h.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/153\/0\/13584126\/il_570xN.1220083705_ch6h.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/153\/0\/13584126\/il_fullxfull.1220083705_ch6h.jpg","full_height":577,"full_width":750},{"listing_image_id":1220083789,"hex_code":"CBBDB4","red":203,"green":189,"blue":180,"hue":23,"saturation":11,"brightness":79,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1491083704,"listing_id":522290371,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/155\/0\/13584126\/il_75x75.1220083789_obtn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/155\/0\/13584126\/il_170x135.1220083789_obtn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/155\/0\/13584126\/il_570xN.1220083789_obtn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/155\/0\/13584126\/il_fullxfull.1220083789_obtn.jpg","full_height":523,"full_width":400},{"listing_image_id":1220090419,"hex_code":"B57E51","red":181,"green":126,"blue":81,"hue":27,"saturation":55,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1491083704,"listing_id":522290371,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/150\/0\/13584126\/il_75x75.1220090419_1kw3.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/150\/0\/13584126\/il_170x135.1220090419_1kw3.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/150\/0\/13584126\/il_570xN.1220090419_1kw3.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/150\/0\/13584126\/il_fullxfull.1220090419_1kw3.jpg","full_height":501,"full_width":750},{"listing_image_id":1220090413,"hex_code":"C7BAAA","red":199,"green":186,"blue":170,"hue":33,"saturation":14,"brightness":78,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1491083704,"listing_id":522290371,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/147\/0\/13584126\/il_75x75.1220090413_egkd.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/147\/0\/13584126\/il_170x135.1220090413_egkd.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/147\/0\/13584126\/il_570xN.1220090413_egkd.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/147\/0\/13584126\/il_fullxfull.1220090413_egkd.jpg","full_height":750,"full_width":750},{"listing_image_id":1435111261,"hex_code":"9D8C79","red":157,"green":140,"blue":121,"hue":32,"saturation":22,"brightness":61,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1514567782,"listing_id":522290371,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/211\/0\/13584126\/il_75x75.1435111261_55iq.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/211\/0\/13584126\/il_170x135.1435111261_55iq.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/211\/0\/13584126\/il_570xN.1435111261_55iq.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/211\/0\/13584126\/il_fullxfull.1435111261_55iq.jpg","full_height":1600,"full_width":800}],"Shop":{"shop_id":13584126,"shop_name":"HappyHerbalistDotCom","user_id":92298596,"creation_tsz":1473020284,"title":"All Natural Probiotic Family Business est 1997","announcement":"Hello good people.

This is not a guaranteed service by the USPS. It is an estimate. Sometimes issues can occur such as mis-routing, weather conditions in states your package may route through, holidays, etc. Major holidays such as CHRISTMAS can incur much longer shipping times.\r\n\r\nIf you have received your shipping notification from USPS and\/or Etsy allow up to 8 shipping days and then notify us. We will submit a MISSING MAIL IN TRANSIT form with USPS. This will often shake loose a package that has become stuck at one of the routing stations. We will need to allow additional time to see if this locates your package. It usually will. We will be checking the tracking daily to see if your package has started to move toward it&#39;s destination before determining it is possibly LOST IN TRANSIT. You will need to be patient and work with us during this process. USPS can sometimes forget to scan an item when they become busy. It does not mean that it&#39;s really lost or never shipped.\r\n\r\nYou will receive a shipping notice from both Etsy and PayPal. Sometimes these can end up in your SPAM folders. Please check there. If you should not receive your order, notification must be within 10 days of the shipping notice &quot;SENT&quot; date. Exceptions are international orders in which case you have 45 days from Shipping Notice &quot;SENT&quot; date to notify us. We will do everything we can to track your delivery. Please be patient while we work to track it down.\r\n\r\nIf your package is LOST sufficient time must be allowed for the USPS investigation to check the status of your package. While they attempt to locate it. We will fill out USPS MISSING MAIL forms. We then allow 5-10 days to see if your package has been located and is moving in transit once again. If your package is not located after investigation period we will proceed with the following. If we have insured your package you will be REQUIRED to sign an affidavit. Refunds\/Replacements will occur after insurance affidavits are signed (if required) and filled out by purchaser (you) and have been submitted to the insurer.\r\n\r\n**DAMAGED MERCHANDISE**\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\nContact us Immediately on receipt of package.
